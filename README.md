# 🧠 AI vs Human Content Detection

This project focuses on building a **machine learning model** that detects whether a given text is **AI-generated** or **human-written**.  
It includes a **Streamlit web application** for interactive predictions, along with training scripts and model files.

🔗 **Live Demo App**: [AI vs Human Content Detection](https://ai-vs-human-content-detection.streamlit.app/)  
🔗 **GitHub Repository**: [AI-vs-Human-Content-Detection](https://github.com/hasaankhan175/AI-vs-Human-Content-Detection)

---

## 🚀 Features
- Detects if text is **AI-generated** or **human-written**
- Interactive **Streamlit UI**
- Uses **NLP techniques** for feature extraction
- Supports custom text input
- Model trained on labeled dataset for accuracy
